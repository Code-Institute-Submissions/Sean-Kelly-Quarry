The main function of the website is to display the various products available and prices of said products and to let customers know how to get in contact with them. The owner of the business also wanted the site to portraythe business as the users personal quarry and to this is achieved in the our team section of the website, allowing users get familiar with their staff.","","## UX","The majority of users on this website will be small to medium sized businesses, in the construction and agricultural sectors. Typically, business owners in these areas will not have access to a desktop or laptop so i used a mobile first design to enure that the site is responsive on all devices. Most of the users of the website will want to place an order or find out out what products are on offer. The website achieves this by having a form that asks users to enter the required details to process an order and displays all products on offer, with prizes, in a simple table.","### User stories:","* As a business owner in the agriculure sector I want to be fit to look at all the products on offer and then place my order with minimal effort. The product list page makes this effortless, allowing me to do all on the same page.","* As business owner in the contruction sector, who was not familiar with local area I had trouble finding the location of the quarry. The embedded google map on the contact page displays the location of the quarry and makes it easier finding the quarry.","","[link to wireframe]","","## Features","* Navbar: Allows users to navigate to all pages on the website","* Slideshow: Instanly shows users that the website is for a quarry.","* About section: Provides users with a brief overview and history of the company.","* Our team section: Allows users to get familiar with the company employees and their position in the company.","* footer section: Provides links to company social media.","* Product table: Shows users all products available and the prices per tonne of each product.","* Order/Queries form: Allows users to submit any orders/queries they want to place.","","### Features left to implement","* Pop up oder form on product page, which will allow users to click on a product and then the order forms pops up in a new window.","","## Technologies used","- [HTML5](https://www.html5tutorial.info/)","    - Used to write the code of the website.","- [CSS3](http://www.css3.info/)","    - Used to style the website.","- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)","    - Used the grid system for the layout of the website.","- [Jquery](https://jquery.com/)","    - Used to embed google maps.","- [Googlefonts](https://fonts.google.com/)","    - Used for additional fonts.","- [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/)","    - Used to add icons to the website.","","## Testing","1. Queries/Contact form:","    (i) Go to contact/product list page.","    (ii) When a user trys to submit either forms without a required field an error message appears. ","    (iii) The phone number field does not allow a user to type text in the field.","2. Links for social media:","    (i) When the social media links are clicked on it opens a new tab for the user.","","In addition to the above tests I have also carried out tests for 4 different browsers (Google chrome, Firefox, Microsoft edge and Safari) and everything looks and works as it should. I also tested how it looks on different device sizes. As I used the mobile first design the website adjusts nicely to the different sizes.","","## Deployment","","","","","## Credits","### Contents","* The Embedded google maps was taken from [embedgooglemap.net](https://www.embedgooglemap.net/)","* The slideshow was taken from [sololearn.com](https://code.sololearn.com/WySlq83B2MC7/#html)","","### Media","* The 3 profile pictures from the our team section were sourced from google images.","* The 3 pictures from the slideshow were my own photos of the quarry.","","### Achknowledgements","* The footer of this project was inspired by the UCD resume mini project I completed with the code institute.","* I also got a lot of help from [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/)",""],"id":11}]]},"ace":{"folds":[],"scrolltop":22.5,"scrollleft":0,"selection":{"start":{"row":64,"column":0},"end":{"row":64,"column":0},"isBackwards":false},"options":{"guessTabSize":true,"useWrapMode":false,"wrapToView":true},"firstLineState":{"row":0,"state":"start","mode":"ace/mode/markdown"}},"timestamp":1583697616536,"hash":"c6427ee4bc3e1486be8d5156d095324d7caf36e4"}
